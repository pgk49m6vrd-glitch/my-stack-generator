## 2025-02-18 - CLI Input Validation
**Vulnerability:** Path traversal risk and invalid package name generation in `create-my-stack` CLI.
**Learning:** CLI tools often trust user input for file paths implicitly. `path.join` resolves paths but doesn't prevent `..` from escaping the intended root if the user input contains it.
**Prevention:** Always validate and sanitize user inputs that are used for file system operations, even in CLI tools.
